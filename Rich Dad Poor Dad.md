## LESSON 1: THE RICH DON'T WORK FOR MONEY

   'The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.'
   
   “The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work, pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.         Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”
   
   "So many people say, “Oh, I’m not interested in money.” Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day."
   
   "The problem was that creating money is legal for the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. There are legal ways to create money from    nothing, he told us.
   
   "Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that    the illusion of money is held together by billions of people who believe that money is real. It’s not. Money is really made up. It is only because of    the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that this house of cards stands.
   
   "Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left to make sure they weren’t borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, and any comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week over a three-month period. We paid his sister one dollar a week and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she was always studying."
