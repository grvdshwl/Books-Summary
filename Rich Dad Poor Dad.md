## LESSON 1: THE RICH DON'T WORK FOR MONEY

   'The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.'
   
   “The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work, pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.         Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”
   
   "So many people say, “Oh, I’m not interested in money.” Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day."
   
   "The problem was that creating money is legal for the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. There are legal ways to create money from    nothing, he told us.
   
   "Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that    the illusion of money is held together by billions of people who believe that money is real. It’s not. Money is really made up. It is only because of    the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that this house of cards stands.
   
   "Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left to make sure they weren’t borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, and any comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week over a three-month period. We paid his sister one dollar a week and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she was always studying."
   
   
## LESSON 2: WHY TEACH FINANCIAL LITERACY?

"It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much money you keep."

Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets,”.

"An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket."

"A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate."

“An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.”

In summary, the end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an investment portfolio impacts an individual in at least the following three ways:

1. Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value.

2. Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high-maintenance expenses related directly to the home.

3. Loss of education. Too often, people count their house
and savings and retirement plans as all they have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply don’t invest. This costs them investment experience. Most never become what the investment world calls “a sophisticated investor.” And the best investments are usually first sold to sophisticated investors, who then turn around and sell them to the people playing it saf

"I am not saying don’t buy a house. What I am saying is that you should understand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house."

### Why the Rich Get Richer
A review of my rich dad’s financial statement shows why the rich get richer. The asset column generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows with it. The result is that the rich get richer!

![Rich Dad Income statement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79152383/168832138-31ec828f-989c-4f92-878e-53dfb575e856.png)


"Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?"


Let’s use an example. Let’s say I have cash flow from my asset column of $1,000 a month. And I have monthly expenses of $2,000. What is my wealth?

Let’s go back to Buckminster Fuller’s definition. Using his definition, how many days forward can I survive? Assuming a 30-day month, I have enough cash flow for half a month.

When I achieve $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then I will be wealthy.
So while I’m not yet rich, I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my cash flow to maintain this level of wealth. Also note that it is at this point that I’m no longer dependent on my wages. I have focused on, and been successful in, building an asset column that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.

My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset column. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows.


   
## LESSON 3: MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS

The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.

"To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income column."

   "Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home."
   
   Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of solid assets.
   
   "An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. "

## LESSON 4: THE HISTORY OF TAXES AND THE POWER OF CORPORATIONS

" My rich dad just played the game smart, and he did it through corporations— the biggest secret of the rich."

"For example, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate that is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is one investment vehicle that has a great tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in value, you will not be taxed on the gains until you liquidate. People who don’t take advantage of these legal tax savings are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns."

Employees earn and get taxed, and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cashflow. For example, by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company expenses. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on. But it’s done legally with pre-tax dollars.

## LESSON 5: THE RICH INVENT MONEY

"Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold."

"Yet the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others."

"It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing. It is gambling if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying."

"A year later, the depressed Oregon real estate market had begun
to pick up. California investors, flush with money from their still booming real estate market, were moving north and buying up Oregon and Washington. I sold that little house for $95,000 to a young
couple from California who thought it was a bargain. My capital
gains of approximately $40,000 were placed into a 1031 tax-deferred exchange, and I went shopping for a place to put my money. In about a month, I found a 12-unit apartment house right next to the Intel plant in Beaverton, Oregon. The owners lived in Germany, had no idea
Rich Dad Poor Dad.

 The problem with “secure” investments is that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.
what the place was worth, and again, just wanted to get out of it. 

I offered $275,000 for a $450,000 building. They agreed to $300,000. I bought it and held it for two years. Utilizing the same 1031-exchange process, we sold the building for $495,000 and bought a 30-unit apartment building in Phoenix,
 Arizona. We had moved to Phoenix by then to get out of the rain, and needed to sell anyway. Like the former Oregon market, the real estate market in Phoenix was depressed. The price of the 30-unit apartment building in Phoenix was $875,000, with $225,000 down. The cash flow from the 30 units was a little over $5,000 a month.
The Arizona market began moving up and, a few years later, a Colorado investor offered us $1.2 million for the property."

Three steps to be an investor :

1. Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.

2. Raise Money.

3. Organize Smart People. 


## LESSON 6: WORK TO LEARN— DON'T WORK FOR MONEY

"Job security meant everything to my educated dad. Learning meant everything to my rich dad."

"financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing, and law."

“You want to know a little about a lot i.e. learn little little about most of things.”

The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing. The ability to sell—to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child—is the base skill of personal success. 

Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success.

Skills to learn via course, Hands on and books :

1. Sales
2. Marketing
3. Negotiation
4. Public Speaking 
5. Body Language
6. Leadership
7. Accounting
8. Investing
9. Law and taxes


# Lesson 7 OVERCOMING OBSTACLES

There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow. The five reasons are:
1. Fear
2. Cynicism
3. Laziness
4. Bad habits
5. Arrogance

“Winning means being unafraid to lose.”

I’ve never met people who have fallen in love who have never had their heart broken. And I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money.

So for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.

I like to quote John D. Rockefeller, who said, “I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity.”

Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers.

Overcome the cyanism or doubt.
